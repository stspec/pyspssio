If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution.
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions.
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks.
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

#

# A large portion of the dictionary entries

#
# Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
# original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED

# in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
# distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
# contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
# jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
#
# NO WARRANTY
#
# The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
# research and development conducted during the project and is provided
# to users as so produced on an experimental basis. Accordingly, the
# program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
# implied, statutory or otherwise. The term "warranty" used herein
# includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
# performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
# the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
# any right of any third party.
#
# Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
# have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
# the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
# otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
#
# Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
# organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
# development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
# officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
# damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
# and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
# with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
# or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
# regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
# knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
# project or thereafter. Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
# foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program. The term
# "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
# modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
# production of secondary products from the program.
#
# In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
# modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
# any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
# grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
# writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
# from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
# above as far as the program is concerned.

3. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its
time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175:
Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
7. Database Ownership
The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
on the database or the code. Any person making a contribution to the
database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
contribution or in the TZ Database.
